  changing federated plugins.
- [Plugin tests](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Plugin-Tests), which explains
  the different kinds of tests used for plugins, where to find them, and how to run them.
  As explained in the Flutter guide,
  [**PRs need tests**](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene#tests), so
  this is critical to read before submitting a plugin PR.

### Style

Flutter packages and plugins follow Google style—or Flutter style for Dart—for the languages they
use, and use auto-formatters:
- [Dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) formatted
  with `dart format`
- [C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) formatted with `clang-format`
    - **Note**: The Linux plugins generally follow idiomatic GObject-based C
      style. See [the engine style
      notes](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#style)
      for more details, and exceptions.
- [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) formatted with
  `google-java-format`
- [Objective-C](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.html) formatted with
  `clang-format`
- [Swift](https://google.github.io/swift/) formatted with `swift-format`
